# Personal Website
## Description
Decided to make a website highlighting information about myself such as programming knowledge,
interests, hardware experience relating to working with clients, and interests outside of programming.
Utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Bootstrap framework for a fluid user experience. Wrote extra
functionality using Django to process user input, validate data, and signals following common security
protocol against exploitation of user data. Used SQLite for the database and PythonAnywhere to host the
site. Sourced and credited philogbâ€™s JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit to display an interactive tree of my
university's computer science degree path.
